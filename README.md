This is a instant message system designed by our web project team

Main Features:
1. RSA encryption on user account(username, password, logging)

2. ReCaptcha auto robot detection on registrtation

3. HTTPS (we used a self-signed SSL certificate which may only run on linux localhost)

4. Creating/Deleting/Joining new chat groups only by invitations

5. In-group chatting history auto-backup

6. JSON for Database management
